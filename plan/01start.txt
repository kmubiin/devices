Project start
--------------------

Getting started:

- purpose: self-maintained documentation
- repository: kmubiin/devices
- contents: plain text (TXT and HTML), with some markup
- policy: open source, but closed contribution
- licensing: tentatively CC-BY-SA

The purpose:

- key idea: any device of interest that may be maintained
  for lifetime, deserves to have some documentation
- the plural noun 'devices' may include: everyday items,
  hand tools, consumer devices, modules and parts, battery
  or cell itself
- documentation heavily based on personal user experience,
  which may or may not be relevant to other users

The repository:

- branches: original ('main'), sub ('docs|page|html'?),
  transient (name by release or revision date)
- subsidiary branch has one name to be decided #later
- transient branch can be removed at anytime, and merging
  by `git merge --no-ff <branch>` will remember the branch
  in the history regardless
- original branch to prepare contents as TXT
- separate, subsidiary branch to publish contents as HTML
- separate, transient branch to make some changes between
  releases that would take some time and effort to do

The contents:

- markup: reStructuredText (reST)
- use markup text to prepare contents, and save as TXT
- use markup tool to publish as HTML when ready
- put documentation first, pretty output last;
- one file for each device (N)
- one file for each issue (Q)
- one file for each changelog with revision date (YYYYMMDD)
- more details to be explained #later

The policy:

- source (text) is open and accessible, but this project
  would not accept any contribution from the public;
- the author however, may acknowledge any notable mentions
  or comments that may have indirectly helped this project
- disable pull request--not possible at this time;
- otherwise use pull request as a feedback channel, which
  may be open or closed, to be explained #later
- contributing file to be included #later

The licensing:

- source text may be licensed under Creative Commons
  Attribution and Share-Alike (CC-BY-SA)
- source code may be licensed under different terms,
  if any, depending on coding language and usage #later
- license file to be included #later

Anything else:

- releases: N.Q (device/issue counts)
- releases to use minimal versioning that is least semantic
  and may not be sequential likewise: 1.0, 2.1, 3.3...
- non-releases: N.Q-YYYYMMDD (with revision date)
- non-releases to make changes to existing contents only,
  with no additional device/issue
- always use lowercase alphanumeric characters for naming
  files and writing commit messages
- use UPPERCASE or Mixed Case for writing the correct and
  accurate information within the file itself
- graphical representation may be included alongside text,
  but method/format to be decided #later
- steps to publish as HTML may be automated #later

----

This plan is based on the impromptu notes in early 2023,
which had few revisions over months, now rewritten here.
Review #later at some point.
