""""""""""""""""""""
Why document things
""""""""""""""""""""

This idiom is whimsical, yet relevant:

    "to leave someone to his or her own devices"

That means, to let them do what he or she wishes.

``kmubiin/devices`` has been manifested by the author's
selfish hope to maintain his own devices (literally).
