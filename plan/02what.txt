``kmubiin/devices`` is a project to document things.

Key idea explained from start:

    Any device of interest that may be maintained
    for lifetime, deserves to have some documentation.

Key terms explained from idea:

"device of interest"  
  Some known or own things selected by the project owner.
  That must be functional, not broken for some time and yet
  usable, at least until some documentation was written.

"for lifetime"  
  As long as the thing works indefinitely, or works beyond
  its service life, provided some parts and maintenance.

"some documentation"  
  Notes that are written based on some experience of using
  the device, which may be limited as a result.

Further explained:

Devices are presumably things that were mass-produced by
machines or replicated by humans. Devices are either:

- purchased off-the-shelf, or
- made from source by users themselves.

The plural noun 'devices' may include any of these:

- everyday items: torch or flashlight, watch, stationery,
  calculator, scales, thermometer
- handy tools: pocket tool, soldering iron, multimeter
- consumer devices: mobile phones, computers, camera,
  printer and scanner, media player
- modules: cable, connector, adapter, battery charger
- parts: electronic kit, repairable or compatible parts
- battery or cell itself

Items with similar traits and subtle differences, may be
documented as "one device". Any items having a similar
product number or same base model, would most likely be
counted as "one device". Such items may be:

- a reusable writing pen that has refill ink catridge, with
  different colours and tip sizes;
- mobile phones of same base model, but different internals
  such as memory and storage size, and supported networks
- rechargeable battery of particular make with different
  size and capacity

Some items may have a common product name, but the actual
products are not identical. Even so, such items made by
different standards may also be documented as "one device".
Such items are not uncommon:

- mobile battery pack from original and third-party makers
  with a common product name, but different capacity
- integrated circuits (ICs) or semiconductor parts with a
  common product name, but given addtional prefix or suffix
  based on their manufacturer or product design

Some common product names may not refer to just one item,
and instead refer to multiple related items. Such items
would belong to the same product family, but each would be
documented collectively as "one device".

- rechargeable battery and charger may share a common
  product name, but battery with compatible size/capacity
  are grouped as "one device", and charger of one type is
  another "one device"
- semiconductor parts of the same product family, whose
  variants of one type are grouped as "one device";
- 5V regulators from the 7800 series of different make,
  such as 7805, L78L05, LM78M05, are all "one device";
- 12V regulators from the 7800 series of different make,
  are all another "one device", which is counted separate
  from the 5V ones, even from the same 7800 series

Else, any unique item with limited information may be
documented as "one device".
