IMPORTANT: Just make a plan or have an intention to do;
however, the plan itself may be revised from time to time
and not necessarily be followed at any time.


Some comments as follows.

.. Heading text with double-quote will be formatted only in
   reStructuredText, yet literal in Markdown and AsciiDoc.
